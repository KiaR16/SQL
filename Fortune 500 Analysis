-- Key Insights:
--   1. Average number of employees and average revenue by industry.
--   2. Technology sector companies with more than 500,000 employees or more than 20 days of paid time off.
--   3. Revenue categorization into 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low' bands.

-- Analysis

-- 1. Find out the average number of employees and average revenue by industry
SELECT industry,
       AVG(employees) AS avg_employees,
       AVG(revenue) AS avg_revenue
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry;

-- 2. Find companies in the Technology sector that have more than 500,000 employees or offer more than 20 days of paid time off
SELECT company_name,
       industry,
       employees,
       paid_time_off_days
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE industry = 'Technology'
  AND (employees > 500000 OR paid_time_off_days > 20);

-- 3. Categorize companies based on revenue into 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low' revenue bands
SELECT company_name,
       industry,
       revenue,
       CASE
           WHEN revenue > 300 THEN 'High'
           WHEN revenue BETWEEN 100 AND 300 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS revenue_band
FROM fortune_companies;

-- 4. Find industries where the average employee tenure is more than 5 years
SELECT industry,
       AVG(avg_employee_tenure) AS average_tenure
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry
HAVING AVG(avg_employee_tenure) > 5;

-- 5. Find the total number of companies that offer maternity leave greater than the average across all companies, and also offer healthcare benefits
SELECT COUNT(*) AS companies_above_average_maternity
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE maternity_leave_weeks > (SELECT AVG(maternity_leave_weeks) FROM fortune_companies)
  AND healthcare_benefits = 1;
