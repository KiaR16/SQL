# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#First I determined the average danceability specifically for the top 10 most popular songs.
SELECT 
  track_name, 
  artist_name, 
  popularity,
  (SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata) AS average_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Second I determined how many times does Doja Cat appear in the Spotify dataset.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS DojaCatAppearances
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name ='Doja Cat'

#Then I determined what artist released the longest song.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms) as longest_duration
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY longest_duration DESC
LIMIT 1;
